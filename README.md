# Yunik's Portfolio Version 2

    After the group project, I wanted to remodel my portfolio with using SASS. 
    It is still under-construction (few more designs and media-queries) but instead of the first portfolio I wanted to show my capability by launching 2nd version. 

    To create this page, it tool about 8 hours. 
    Of course, I am going to re-write whole readme when I complete this website.
